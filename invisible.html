    <h1>The Power of Invisibility</h1>

    <p>
      One day you blink, and your reflection disappears from the mirror.
      Your clothes still hang in the air, but your body is completely gone.
      You slowly realize it: you are invisible.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first it feels exciting. You can walk through a crowded street without
      anybody bumping into you. You can sit in a busy café and listen to
      conversations, or sneak into a movie theater without buying a ticket.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after a while, the excitement starts to fade. Your friends talk to you
      on the phone, but they cannot look you in the eyes. In group photos,
      there is always an empty space where you should be. Even your Uber driver
      keeps calling you, saying: “I’m here… but where are you?”
    </p>

    <p>
      You can see everyone, but nobody can really see you.
