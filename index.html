    <h1>Welcome to MMP 100!</h1>

    <p>
      In this class, we will explore different ways to create stories and interactive media.
      Today, you will start a tiny interactive story about yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine you wake up one morning and discover that you suddenly have a superpower.
      You look in the mirror, take a deep breath, and decide:
    </p>

    <p>Which power would you like to have for the rest of your life?</p>

    <p>
      I would like to have
      <a href="Story/fly.html">the power of flying</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to have
      <a href="Story/invisible.html">the power of invisibility</a>.
    </p>

      This simple website is part of my MMP 100 project: a short “choose your own adventure”
      story built with HTML and CSS.
